# sightWords

This is very much a work in progress, and as such concise and clear running instructions are not possible right now. These will follow as soon as the database structure is stable.

Components:

HTML and CSS frame
Javascript game function elements - JSON objects are parsed, and questions and word flashcards are developed
PHP processes server-side information, and retrieves from and updates the database.
mySQL contains user and word data
